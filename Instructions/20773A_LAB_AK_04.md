## Lab: Processing big data

## Exercise 1: Merging the airport and flight delay datasets

### Task 1: Copy the data to the shared folder

1. Log in to the VM as **.\\student** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. Using **File Explorer**, move to the folder **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab04**, and then double-click the file **FlightDelayData.part1.exe**
3. In the **WinRAR self-extracting archive** dialog box, click **Extract**.
4. Open a command prompt window.
5. Run the following commands:

    ```CMD
    copy E:\Labfiles\Lab04\airportData.xdf E:\Data
    copy E:\Labfiles\Lab04\FlightDelayData.xdf E:\\Data
    ```

6. If the **Overwrite** message appears, type **y**, and then press Enter.
8. Verify that both files are copied successfully.

### Task 2: Refactor the data

1. Start your R development environment of choice (Visual Studio, or RStudio), and create a new R file.
2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement creates a remote R session on the server:

    ```R
    remoteLogin(deployr_endpoint = "http://localhost:12800", session = TRUE, diff = TRUE, commandline = TRUE, username = "admin", password = "Pa55w.rd")
    ```

3. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code retrieves the information for the **iata** variable in the **airportData** XDF file and displays it. The code then performs this same operation for the **Origin** and **Dest** variables in the **FlightDelayData** XDF file:

    ```R
    airportData = RxXdfData("E:\\Data\\airportData.xdf")
    flightDelayData = RxXdfData("E:\\Data\\flightDelayData.xdf")
    iataFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(airportData, varsToKeep = c("iata"))
    print(iataFactor)
    originFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(flightDelayData, varsToKeep = c("Origin"))
    print(originFactor)
    destFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(flightDelayData, varsToKeep = c("Dest"))
    print(destFactor)
    ```

4. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates a new set of factor levels using the levels in the **iata**, **Origin**, and **Dest** variables:

    ```R
    refactorLevels <- unique(c(iataFactor$iata[["levels"]],
        originFactor$Origin[["levels"]],
        destFactor$Dest[["levels"]]
    ))
    ```

5. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code refactors the **iata** variable in the **airportData** XDF file with the new factor levels:

    ```R
    rxOptions(reportProgress = 2)
    refactoredAirportDataFile <- "E:\\Data\\RefactoredAirportData.xdf"
    refactoredAirportData <- rxFactors(inData = airportData, outFile = refactoredAirportDataFile,
        overwrite = TRUE, factorInfo = list(iata = list(newLevels = refactorLevels))
    )
    ```

6. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code refactors the **Origin** and **Dest** variables in the **FlightDelayData** XDF file with the new factor levels:

    ```R
    refactoredFlightDelayDataFile <- "E:\\Data\\RefactoredFlightDelayData.xdf"
    refactoredFlightDelayData <- rxFactors(inData = flightDelayData, outFile =
        refactoredFlightDelayDataFile, overwrite = TRUE,
        factorInfo = list(Origin = list(newLevels = refactorLevels),
                          Dest = list(newLevels = refactorLevels))
    )
    ```

7. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code displays the new factor levels for the **iata**, **Origin**, and **Dest** variables. They should all be the same now:

    ```R
    iataFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(refactoredAirportData, varsToKeep = c("iata"))
    print(iataFactor)
    originFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(refactoredFlightDelayData, varsToKeep = c("Origin"))
    print(originFactor)
    destFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(refactoredFlightDelayData, varsToKeep = c("Dest"))
    print(destFactor)
    ```

### Task 3: Merge the datasets

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code renames the **iata** field in the refactored airport data file to **Origin**:

    ```R
    names(refactoredAirportData)[[1]] <- "Origin"
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code reblocks the airport data XDF file:

    ```R
    reblockedAirportDataFile <- "E:\\Data\\reblockedAirportData.xdf"
    reblockedAirportData <- rxDataStep(refactoredAirportData,
        reblockedAirportDataFile, overwrite = TRUE
    )
    ```

3. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code uses the **rxMerge** function to merge the two XDF files, performing an inner join over the **Origin** field:

    ```R
    mergedFlightDelayDataFile <- "E:\\Data\\MergedFlightDelayData.xdf"
    mergedFlightDelayData <- rxMerge(inData1 = refactoredFlightDelayData, inData2 = reblockedAirportData,
        outFile = mergedFlightDelayDataFile, overwrite = TRUE,
        type = "inner", matchVars = c("Origin"), autoSort = TRUE,
        varsToKeep2 = c("timezone", "Origin"),
        newVarNames2 = c(timezone = "OriginTimeZone"),
        rowsPerOutputBlock = 500000
    )
    ```

4. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code examines the structure of the new flight delay data file that should now include the **OriginTimeZone** variable, and displays the first and last few rows:

    ```R
    rxGetVarInfo(mergedFlightDelayData)
    head(mergedFlightDelayData)
    tail(mergedFlightDelayData)
    ```

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created a new dataset that combines information from the flight delay data and airport information datasets.

## Exercise 2: Transforming departure and arrival dates to UTC

### Task 1: Generate a sample of the flight delay data

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates a new XDF file containing 0.5% of the data in the flight delay data file (approximately 20,000 rows):

    ```R
    rxOptions(reportProgress = 1)
    flightDelayDataSubsetFile <- "E:\\Data\\flightDelayDataSubset.xdf"
    flightDelayDataSubset <- rxDataStep(inData = mergedFlightDelayData,
        outFile = flightDelayDataSubsetFile, overwrite = TRUE,
        rowSelection = rbinom(.rxNumRows, size = 1, prob = 0.005)
    )
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code displays the metadata for the XDF file containing the sample data:

    ```R
    rxGetInfo(flightDelayDataSubset, getBlockSizes = TRUE)
    ```

### Task 2: Transform the data

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement installs the **lubridate** package:

    ```R
    install.packages("lubridate")
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code implements the **standardizeTimes** transformation function:

    ```R
    standardizeTimes <- function (dataList) {
        # Check to see whether this is a test chunk
        if (.rxIsTestChunk) {
            return(dataList)
        }

        # Create a new vector for holding the standardized departure time
        # and add it to the list of variable values
        departureTimeVarIndex <- length(dataList) + 1
        dataList[[departureTimeVarIndex]] <- rep(as.numeric(NA), times = .rxNumRows)
        names(dataList)[departureTimeVarIndex] <- "StandardizedDepartureTime"

        # Do the same for standardized arrival time
        arrivalTimeVarIndex <- length(dataList) + 1
        dataList[[arrivalTimeVarIndex]] <- rep(as.numeric(NA), times = .rxNumRows)
        names(dataList)[arrivalTimeVarIndex] <- "StandardizedArrivalTime"
        departureYearVarIndex <- 1
        departureMonthVarIndex <- 2
        departureDayVarIndex <- 3
        departureTimeStringVarIndex <- 4
        elapsedTimeVarIndex <- 5
        departureTimezoneVarIndex <- 6

        # Iterate through the rows and add the standardized arrival and departure times
        for (i in 1:.rxNumRows) {
            # Get the local departure time details
            departureYear <- dataList[[departureYearVarIndex]][i]
            departureMonth <- dataList[[departureMonthVarIndex]][i]
            departureDay <- dataList[[departureDayVarIndex]][i]
            departureHour <- trunc(as.numeric(dataList[[departureTimeStringVarIndex]][i]) / 100)
            departureMinute <- as.numeric(dataList[[departureTimeStringVarIndex]][i]) %% 100
            departureTimeZone <- dataList[[departureTimezoneVarIndex]][i]

            # Construct the departure date and time, including timezone
            departureDateTimeString <- paste(departureYear, "-", departureMonth, "-", departureDay, " ", departureHour, ":", departureMinute, sep="")
            departureDateTime <- as.POSIXct(departureDateTimeString, tz = departureTimeZone)

            # Convert to UTC and store it
            standardizedDepartureDateTime <- format(departureDateTime, tz="UTC")
            dataList[[departureTimeVarIndex]][i] <- standardizedDepartureDateTime

            # Calculate the arrival date and time
            # Do this by adding the elapsed time to the departure time
            # The elapsed time is stored as the number of minutes (an integer)
            elapsedTime = dataList[[5]][i]
            standardizedArrivalDateTime <- format(as.POSIXct(standardizedDepartureDateTime) + minutes(elapsedTime))

            # Store it
            dataList[[arrivalTimeVarIndex]][i] <- standardizedArrivalDateTime
        }

        # Return the data including the new variables
        return(dataList)
    }
    ```

3. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code uses the **rxDataStep** function to perform the transformation:

    ```R
    flightDelayDataTimeZonesFile <- "E:\\Data\\flightDelayDataTimezones.xdf"
    flightDelayDataTimeZones <- rxDataStep(inData = flightDelayDataSubset,
        outFile = flightDelayDataTimeZonesFile, overwrite = TRUE,
        transformFunc = standardizeTimes,
        transformVars = c("Year", "Month", "DayofMonth", "DepTime", "ActualElapsedTime", "OriginTimeZone"),
        transformPackages = c("lubridate")
    )
    ```

4. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code examines the transformed data file:

    ```R
    rxGetVarInfo(flightDelayDataTimeZones)
    head(flightDelayDataTimeZones)
    tail(flightDelayDataTimeZones)
    ```

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have implemented a transformation function that adds variables containing the standardized departure and arrival times to the flight delay dataset.

## Exercise 3: Calculating cumulative average delays for each route

### Task 1: Sort the data

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code sorts the flight delay data by departure date:

    ```R
    sortedFlightDelayDataFile <- "sortedFlightDelayData.xdf"
    sortedFlightDelayData <- rxSort(inData = flightDelayDataTimeZones,
        outFile = sortedFlightDelayDataFile, overwrite = TRUE,
        sortByVars = c("StandardizedDepartureTime")
    )
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code displays the first and last few lines of the sorted file. Examine the data in the **StandardizedDepartureTime** variable:

    ```R
    head(sortedFlightDelayData)
    tail(sortedFlightDelayData)
    ```

### Task 2: Calculate the cumulative average delays

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code implements the **calculateCumulativeAverageDelays** transformation function:

    ```R
    calculateCumulativeAverageDelays <- function (dataList) {
        # Check to see whether this is a test chunk
        if (.rxIsTestChunk) {
            return(dataList)
        }

        # Add a new vector for holding the cumulative average delay
        # and add it to the list of variable values
        cumulativeAverageDelayVarIndex <- length(dataList) + 1
        dataList[[cumulativeAverageDelayVarIndex]] <- rep(as.numeric(NA), times = .rxNumRows)
        names(dataList)[cumulativeAverageDelayVarIndex] <- "CumulativeAverageDelayForRoute"
        originVarIndex <- 1
        destVarIndex <- 2
        delayVarIndex <- 3

        # Retrieve the vector containing the cumulative delays recorded so far for each route
        cumulativeDelays <- .rxGet("cumulativeDelays")

        # Retrieve the vecor containing the number of times each route has occurred so far
        cumulativeRouteOccurrences <- .rxGet("cumulativeRouteOccurrences")

        # Iterate through the rows and add the standardized arrival and departure times
        for (i in 1:.rxNumRows) {

            # Get the route and delay details
            origin <- dataList[[originVarIndex]][i]
            dest <- dataList[[destVarIndex]][i]
            routeDelay <- dataList[[delayVarIndex]][i]

            # Create a string that identifies the route
            route <- paste(origin, dest, sep = "")

            # Retrieve the current cumulative delay and number of occurrences for each route
            delay <- cumulativeDelays[[route]]
            occurrences <- cumulativeRouteOccurrences[[route]]

            # Update the cumulative statistics
            delay <- ifelse(is.null(delay), 0, delay) + routeDelay
            occurrences <- ifelse(is.null(occurrences), 0, occurrences) + 1

            # Work out the new running average delay for the route
            cumulativeAverageDelay <- delay / occurrences

            # Store the data and updated stats
            dataList[[cumulativeAverageDelayVarIndex]][i] <- cumulativeAverageDelay
            cumulativeDelays[[route]] <- delay
            cumulativeRouteOccurrences[[route]] <- occurrences
        }

        # Save the lists containing the cumulative data so far
        .rxSet("cumulativeDelays", cumulativeDelays)
        .rxSet("cumulativeRouteOccurrences", cumulativeRouteOccurrences)

        # Return the data including the new variable
        return(dataList)
    }
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code uses **rxDataStep** to run the **calculateCumulativeAverageDelays** transformation function:

    ```R
    flightDelayDataWithAveragesFile <- "E:\\Data\\flightDelayDataWithAverages.xdf"
    flightDelayDataWithAverages <- rxDataStep(inData = sortedFlightDelayData,
        outFile = flightDelayDataWithAveragesFile, overwrite = TRUE,
        transformFunc = calculateCumulativeAverageDelays,
        transformVars = c("Origin", "Dest", "Delay"),
        transformObjects = list(cumulativeDelays = list(), cumulativeRouteOccurrences = list())
    )
    ```

### Task 3: Verify the results

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code examines the transformed data file:

    ```R
    rxGetVarInfo(flightDelayDataWithAverages)
    head(flightDelayDataWithAverages)
    tail(flightDelayDataWithAverages)
    ```
2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This creates a scatter and regression plot showing the cumulative average delay for flights from ATL to PHX (Atlanta to Phoenix):

    ```R
    rxLinePlot(CumulativeAverageDelayForRoute ~ as.POSIXct(StandardizedDepartureTime), type = c("p", "r"),
        flightDelayDataWithAverages,
        rowSelection = (Origin == "ATL") & (Dest == "PHX"),
        yTitle = "Cumulative Average Delay for Route",
        xTitle = "Date"
    )
    ```

3. Repeat step 2 and replace the **rowSelection** argument with each of the following values in turn:
    - rowSelection = (Origin == "SFO") & (Dest == "LAX")
    - rowSelection = (Origin == "LAX") & (Dest == "SFO")
    - rowSelection = (Origin == "DEN") & (Dest == "SLC")
    - rowSelection = (Origin == "LGA") & (Dest == "ORD")

4. Save the script as **Lab4Script.R** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab04** folder, and close your R development environment.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have sorted data, and created and tested another transformation function.
