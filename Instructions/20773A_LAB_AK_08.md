## Lab: Deploying a predictive model to SQL Server

## Exercise 1: Upload the flight delay data

### Task 1: Configure SQL Server and create the FlightDelays database

1. Log on to the **LON-DEV** VM as **.\\student** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. On the Windows desktop, click **Start**, type **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**, and then press Enter.
3. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, log on using Windows authentication.
4. In the toolbar, click **New Query**.
5. In the **Query** window, type the following commands. These commands enable you to run the **sp\_execute\_external\_script** stored procedure:

    ````SQL
    sp_configure 'external scripts enabled', 1;
    RECONFIGURE;
    ````

6. In the toolbar, click **Execute**.
7. In Object Explorer, right-click on the server name, and then click **Restart**.
8. In the **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** message box, click **Yes**.
9. In the second **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** message box, click **Yes**.
10. Wait for SQL Server to restart.
11. In Object Explorer, expand the server and right-click **Databases**, and then click **New Database**.
12. In the **New Database** dialog box, in the **Database name** text box, type **FlightDelays**, and then click **OK**.
13. Leave SQL Server Management Studio open.

### Task 2: Upload the flight delay data to SQL Server

1. Open a command prompt window.
2. Run the following commands:

    ````CMD
    
    copy E:\Labfiles\Lab08\FlightDelayDataSample.xdf E:\Data
    ````

3. Verify that the file is copied successfully, and then close the command prompt.
4. Start your R development environment of choice (Visual Studio 2017, or RStudio), and create a new R file.
5. In the script editor, add the following statement to the R file and run it. This code ensures that you are running in the local compute context:

    ````R
    rxSetComputeContext(RxLocalSeq())
    ````

6. In the script editor, add the following statements to the R file and run them. This code creates a connection string for the SQL Server **FlightDelays** database, and an **RxSqlServerData** data source for the **flightdelaydata** table in the database:

    ````R
    connStr <- "Driver=SQL Server;Server=(local);Database=FlightDelays;Trusted_Connection=Yes"
    flightDelayDataTable <- RxSqlServerData(connectionString = connStr, table = "flightdelaydata")
    ````

7. Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements import the data from the **FlightDelayDataSample.xdf** file and adds the **DelayedByWeather** logical factor and **Dataset** column to each observation:

    ````R
    rxOptions("reportProgress" = 2)
    flightDelayDataFile <- "E:\\Data\\FlightDelayDataSample.xdf"
    flightDelayData <- rxDataStep(inData = flightDelayDataFile,
        outFile = flightDelayDataTable, overwrite = TRUE,
        transforms = list(DelayedByWeather = factor(ifelse(is.na(WeatherDelay), 0, WeatherDelay) > 0, levels = c(FALSE, TRUE)),
        Dataset = factor(ifelse(runif(.rxNumRows) >= 0.05, "train", "test")))
    )
    ````

### Task 3: Examine the data in the database

1. Add the following statements to the R file and run them. This code creates a new SQL Server compute context:

    ````R
    sqlWait <- TRUE
    sqlConsoleOutput <- TRUE
    sqlContext <- RxInSqlServer(connectionString = connStr,
        wait = sqlWait, consoleOutput = sqlConsoleOutput
    )
    rxSetComputeContext(sqlContext)
    ````

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements create an **RxSqlServerData** data source that reads the flight delay data from the SQL Server database and refactors it:

    ````R
    weatherDelayQuery = "SELECT Month, MonthName, OriginState, DestState,
        Dataset, DelayedByWeather, WeatherDelayCategory = CASE
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) <= 0 THEN 'No delay'
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 1 AND 30 THEN '1-30 minutes'
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 31 AND 60 THEN '31-60 minutes'
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 61 AND 120 THEN '61-120 minutes'
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 121 AND 180 THEN '121-180 minutes'
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) >= 181 THEN 'More than 180 minutes'
        END
        FROM flightdelaydata"

    delayDataSource <- RxSqlServerData(sqlQuery = weatherDelayQuery,
        colClasses = c(
            Month = "factor",
            OriginState = "factor",
            DestState = "factor",
            Dataset = "character",
            DelayedByWeather = "factor",
            WeatherDelayCategory = "factor"
        ),
        colInfo = list(
            MonthName = list(
                type = "factor",
                levels = month.name
            )
        ),
        connectionString = connStr
    )
    ````

3. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement retrieves the details for each variable in the data source:

    ````R
    rxGetVarInfo(delayDataSource)
    ````

    There should be seven variables, named **Month**, **MonthName**, **OriginState**, **DestState**, **Dataset**, **DelayedByWeather**, and **WeatherDelayCategory**.

4. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement retrieves the data from the data source and summarizes it:

    ````R
    rxSummary(~., delayDataSource)
    ````

5. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement creates a histogram that shows the categorized delays by month:

    ````R
    rxHistogram(~WeatherDelayCategory | MonthName,
        data = delayDataSource,
        xTitle = "Weather Delay",
        scales = (list(
            x = list(rot = 90)
        ))
    )
    ````

6. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement creates a histogram that shows the categorized delays by origin state:

    ````R
    rxHistogram(~WeatherDelayCategory | OriginState,
        data = delayDataSource,
        xTitle = "Weather Delay",
        scales = (list(
            x = list(rot = 90, cex = 0.5)
        ))
    )
    ````

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have imported the flight delay data to SQL Server and used ScaleR functions to examine this data.

## Exercise 2: Fit a DForest model to the weather delay data

### Task 1: Create a DForest model

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement fits a DTree model to the weather delay data:

    ````R
    weatherDelayModel <- rxDForest(DelayedByWeather ~ Month + OriginState + DestState,
        data = delayDataSource,
        cp = 0.0001,
        rowSelection = (Dataset == "train")
    )
    ````

2. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement summarizes the forecast accuracy of the model:

    ````R
    print(weatherDelayModel)
    ````

3. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement shows the structure of the decision trees in the DForest model:

    ````R
    head(weatherDelayModel)
    ````

4. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement shows the relative importance of each predictor variable to the decisions made by the model:

    ````R
    rxVarUsed (weatherDelayModel)
    ````

### Task 2: Score the DForest model

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement modifies the query used by the data source and adds a WHERE clause to limit the rows retrieved to the test data:

    ````R
    delayDataSource@sqlQuery <- paste(delayDataSource@sqlQuery, "WHERE Dataset = 'test'", sep = " ")
    ````

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement creates a data source that will be used to store scored results in the database:

    ````R
    weatherDelayScoredResults <- RxSqlServerData(connectionString = connStr, table = "scoredresults")
    ````

3. Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements switch to the local compute context, generate weather delay predictions using the new data set and save the scored results in the **scoredresults** table in the database, and then return to the SQL Server compute context:

    ````R
    rxSetComputeContext(RxLocalSeq())
    rxPredict(modelObj = weatherDelayModel,
        data = delayDataSource,
        outData = weatherDelayScoredResults, overwrite = TRUE,
        writeModelVars = TRUE,
        predVarNames = c("PredictedDelay", "PredictedNoDelay", "PredictedDelayedByWeather"),
        type = "prob"
    )
    rxSetComputeContext(sqlContext)
    ````

4. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code tests the scored results against the real data and plots the accuracy of the predictions:

    ````R
    install.packages('ROCR')
    library(ROCR)

    # Transform the prediction data into a standardized form
    results <- rxImport(weatherDelayScoredResults)
    weatherDelayPredictions <- prediction(results$PredictedDelay, results$DelayedByWeather)

    # Plot the ROC curve of the predictions
    rocCurve <- performance(weatherDelayPredictions, measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
    plot(rocCurve)
    ````

5. If the **Microsoft Visual Studio** dialog boxes appear, click **Yes**.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created a decision tree forest using the weather data held in the SQL Server database, scored it, and stored the results back in the database.

## Exercise 3: Store the model in SQL Server

### Task 1: Save the model to the database

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements created a serialized representation of the model as a string of binary data:

    ````R
    serializedModel <- serialize(weatherDelayModel, NULL)
    serializedModelString <- paste(serializedModel, collapse = "")
    ````

2. Return to SQL Server Management Studio.

3. In the toolbar, click **New Query**. In the Query window, type the following code:

    ````SQL
    USE FlightDelays;
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[delaymodels]
    (
        modelId INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL Primary KEY,
        model VARBINARY(MAX) NOT NULL
    );
    ````

4. In the toolbar, click **Execute**. Verify that the code runs without any errors.
5. Overwrite the code in the **Query** window with the following block of Transact-SQL:

    ````SQL
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[PersistModel] @m NVARCHAR(MAX)
    AS
    BEGIN
        SET NOCOUNT ON;
        INSERT INTO delaymodels(model) VALUES (CONVERT(VARBINARY(MAX),@m,2))
    END;
    ````

6. In the toolbar, click **Execute**. Verify that the code runs without any errors.
7. Return to your R development environment.
8. Add the following statements to the R file and run it. This code uses an ODBC connection to run the **PersistModel** stored procedure and save your DTree model to the database:

    ````R
    install.packages('RODBC')
    library(RODBC)
    connection <- odbcDriverConnect(connStr)
    cmd <- paste("EXEC PersistModel @m='", serializedModelString, "'", sep = "")
    sqlQuery(connection, cmd)
    ````

### Task 2: Create a stored procedure that runs the model to make predictions

1. Switch back to SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Overwrite the code in the **Query** window with the following block of Transact-SQL:

    ````SQL
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[PredictWeatherDelay]
    @Month integer = 1,
    @OriginState char(2),
    @DestState char(2)
    AS
    BEGIN
        DECLARE @weatherDelayModel varbinary(max) = (SELECT TOP 1 model FROM dbo.delaymodels)
        EXEC sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R', @script = N'
            delayParams <- data.frame(Month = month, OriginState = originState, DestState = destState)
            delayModel <- unserialize(as.raw(model))
            OutputDataSet<-rxPredict(modelObject = delayModel,
            data = delayParams,
            outData = NULL,
            predVarNames = c("PredictedDelay", "PredictedNoDelay", "PredictedDelayedByWeather"),
            type = "prob",
            writeModelVars = TRUE)',
        @params = N'@model varbinary(max),
            @month integer,
            @originState char(2),
            @destState char(2)',
            @model = @weatherDelayModel,
            @month = @Month,
            @originState = @OriginState,
            @destState = @DestState
        WITH RESULT SETS (([PredictedDelay] float, [PredictedNoDelay] float, [PredictedDelayedByWeather] bit, [Month] integer, [OriginState] char(2), [DestState] char(2)));
    END
    ````

3. In the toolbar, click **Execute**. Verify that the code runs without any errors.
4. Return to your R development environment.
5. Add the following statements to the R file and run it. This code tests the stored procedure:

    ```` R
    cmd <- "EXEC [dbo].[PredictWeatherDelay] @Month = 10, @OriginState = 'MI', @DestState = 'NY'"
    sqlQuery(connection, cmd)
    ````

6. Save the script as **Lab8\_1Script.R** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08** folder, and close your R development environment.
7. Close SQL Server Management Studio, without saving any changes.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have saved the DForest model to SQL Server, and created a stored procedure that you can use to make weather delay predictions using this model.
