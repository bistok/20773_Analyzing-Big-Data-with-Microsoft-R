12. In the **New Database** dialog box, in the **Database name** text box, type **FlightDelays**, and then click **OK**.
13. Leave SQL Server Management Studio open.

### Task 2: Upload the flight delay data to SQL Server

1. Open a command prompt window.
2. Run the following commands:

    ```CMD
    net use \\LON-RSVR\Data
    copy E:\Labfiles\Lab08\FlightDelayDataSample.xdf \\LON-RSVR\Data
    ```

3. Verify that the file is copied successfully, and then close the command prompt.
4. Start your R development environment of choice (Visual Studio, or RStudio), and create a new R file.
5. In the script editor, add the following statement to the R file and run it. This code ensures that you are running in the local compute context:

    ```R
    rxSetComputeContext(RxLocalSeq())
    ```

6. In the script editor, add the following statements to the R file and run them. This code creates a connection string for the SQL Server **FlightDelays** database, and an **RxSqlServerData** data source for the **flightdelaydata** table in the database:

    ```R
    connStr <- "Driver=SQL Server;Server=LON-SQLR;Database=FlightDelays;Trusted_Connection=Yes"
    flightDelayDataTable <- RxSqlServerData(connectionString = connStr, table = "flightdelaydata")
    ```

7. Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements import the data from the **FlightDelayDataSample.xdf** file and adds the **DelayedByWeather** logical factor and **Dataset** column to each observation:

    ```R
    rxOptions("reportProgress" = 2)
    flightDelayDataFile <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\FlightDelayDataSample.xdf"
    flightDelayData <- rxDataStep(inData = flightDelayDataFile,
        outFile = flightDelayDataTable, overwrite = TRUE,
        transforms = list(DelayedByWeather = factor(ifelse(is.na(WeatherDelay), 0, WeatherDelay) > 0, levels = c(FALSE, TRUE)),
        Dataset = factor(ifelse(runif(.rxNumRows) >= 0.05, "train", "test")))
    )
    ```

### Task 3: Examine the data in the database

1. Add the following statements to the R file and run them. This code creates a new SQL Server compute context:

    ```R
    sqlWait <- TRUE
    sqlConsoleOutput <- TRUE
    sqlContext <- RxInSqlServer(connectionString = connStr,
        wait = sqlWait, consoleOutput = sqlConsoleOutput
    )
    rxSetComputeContext(sqlContext)
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements create an **RxSqlServerData** data source that reads the flight delay data from the SQL Server database and refactors it:

    ```R
    weatherDelayQuery = "SELECT Month, MonthName, OriginState, DestState,
        Dataset, DelayedByWeather, WeatherDelayCategory = CASE
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) <= 0 THEN 'No delay'
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 1 AND 30 THEN '1-30 minutes'
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 31 AND 60 THEN '31-60 minutes'
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 61 AND 120 THEN '61-120 minutes'
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 121 AND 180 THEN '121-180 minutes'
            WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) >= 181 THEN 'More than 180 minutes'
        END
        FROM flightdelaydata"

    delayDataSource <- RxSqlServerData(sqlQuery = weatherDelayQuery,
        colClasses = c(
            Month = "factor",
            OriginState = "factor",
            DestState = "factor",
            Dataset = "character",
            DelayedByWeather = "factor",
            WeatherDelayCategory = "factor"
        ),
        colInfo = list(
            MonthName = list(
                type = "factor",
                levels = month.name
            )
        ),
        connectionString = connStr
    )
    ```

3. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement retrieves the details for each variable in the data source:

    ```R
    rxGetVarInfo(delayDataSource)
    ```

    There should be seven variables, named **Month**, **MonthName**, **OriginState**, **DestState**, **Dataset**, **DelayedByWeather**, and **WeatherDelayCategory**.

4. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement retrieves the data from the data source and summarizes it:

    ```R
    rxSummary(~., delayDataSource)
    ```

5. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement creates a histogram that shows the categorized delays by month:

    ```R
    rxHistogram(~WeatherDelayCategory | MonthName,
        data = delayDataSource,
        xTitle = "Weather Delay",
        scales = (list(
            x = list(rot = 90)
        ))
    )
    ```

6. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement creates a histogram that shows the categorized delays by origin state:

    ```R
    rxHistogram(~WeatherDelayCategory | OriginState,
        data = delayDataSource,
        xTitle = "Weather Delay",
        scales = (list(
            x = list(rot = 90, cex = 0.5)
        ))
    )
    ```

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have imported the flight delay data to SQL Server and used ScaleR functions to examine this data.

## Exercise 2: Fit a DForest model to the weather delay data

### Task 1: Create a DForest model

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement fits a DTree model to the weather delay data:

    ```R
    weatherDelayModel <- rxDForest(DelayedByWeather ~ Month + OriginState + DestState,
        data = delayDataSource,
        cp = 0.0001,
        rowSelection = (Dataset == "train")
    )
    ```

2. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement summarizes the forecast accuracy of the model:

    ```R
    print(weatherDelayModel)
    ```

3. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement shows the structure of the decision trees in the DForest model:

    ```R
    head(weatherDelayModel)
    ```

4. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement shows the relative importance of each predictor variable to the decisions made by the model:

    ```R
    rxVarUsed (weatherDelayModel)
    ```

### Task 2: Score the DForest model

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement modifies the query used by the data source and adds a WHERE clause to limit the rows retrieved to the test data:

    ```R
    delayDataSource@sqlQuery <- paste(delayDataSource@sqlQuery, "WHERE Dataset = 'test'", sep = " ")
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement creates a data source that will be used to store scored results in the database:

    ```R
    weatherDelayScoredResults <- RxSqlServerData(connectionString = connStr, table = "scoredresults")
    ```

3. Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements switch to the local compute context, generate weather delay predictions using the new data set and save the scored results in the **scoredresults** table in the database, and then return to the SQL Server compute context:

    ```R
    rxSetComputeContext(RxLocalSeq())
    rxPredict(modelObj = weatherDelayModel,
        data = delayDataSource,
        outData = weatherDelayScoredResults, overwrite = TRUE,
        writeModelVars = TRUE,
        predVarNames = c("PredictedDelay", "PredictedNoDelay", "PredictedDelayedByWeather"),
        type = "prob"
    )
    rxSetComputeContext(sqlContext)
    ```

4. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code tests the scored results against the real data and plots the accuracy of the predictions:

    ```R
    install.packages('ROCR')
    library(ROCR)

    # Transform the prediction data into a standardized form
    results <- rxImport(weatherDelayScoredResults)
    weatherDelayPredictions <- prediction(results$PredictedDelay, results$DelayedByWeather)

    # Plot the ROC curve of the predictions
    rocCurve <- performance(weatherDelayPredictions, measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
    plot(rocCurve)
    ```

5. If the **Microsoft Visual Studio** dialog boxes appear, click **Yes**.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created a decision tree forest using the weather data held in the SQL Server database, scored it, and stored the results back in the database.

## Exercise 3: Store the model in SQL Server

### Task 1: Save the model to the database

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements created a serialized representation of the model as a string of binary data:

    ```R
    serializedModel <- serialize(weatherDelayModel, NULL)
    serializedModelString <- paste(serializedModel, collapse = "")
    ```

2. Return to SQL Server Management Studio.

3. In the toolbar, click **New Query**. In the Query window, type the following code:

    ```SQL
    USE FlightDelays;
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[delaymodels]
    (
        modelId INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL Primary KEY,
        model VARBINARY(MAX) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

4. In the toolbar, click **Execute**. Verify that the code runs without any errors.
5. Overwrite the code in the **Query** window with the following block of Transact-SQL:

    ```SQL
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[PersistModel] @m NVARCHAR(MAX)
    AS
    BEGIN
        SET NOCOUNT ON;
        INSERT INTO delaymodels(model) VALUES (CONVERT(VARBINARY(MAX),@m,2))
    END;
    ```

6. In the toolbar, click **Execute**. Verify that the code runs without any errors.
7. Return to your R development environment.
8. Add the following statements to the R file and run it. This code uses an ODBC connection to run the **PersistModel** stored procedure and save your DTree model to the database:

    ```R
    install.packages('RODBC')
    library(RODBC)
    connection <- odbcDriverConnect(connStr)
    cmd <- paste("EXEC PersistModel @m='", serializedModelString, "'", sep = "")
    sqlQuery(connection, cmd)
    ```

### Task 2: Create a stored procedure that runs the model to make predictions

1. Switch back to SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Overwrite the code in the **Query** window with the following block of Transact-SQL:

    ```SQL
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[PredictWeatherDelay]
    @Month integer = 1,
    @OriginState char(2),
    @DestState char(2)
    AS
    BEGIN
        DECLARE @weatherDelayModel varbinary(max) = (SELECT TOP 1 model FROM dbo.delaymodels)
        EXEC sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R', @script = N'
            delayParams <- data.frame(Month = month, OriginState = originState, DestState = destState)
            delayModel <- unserialize(as.raw(model))
            OutputDataSet<-rxPredict(modelObject = delayModel,
            data = delayParams,
            outData = NULL,
            predVarNames = c("PredictedDelay", "PredictedNoDelay", "PredictedDelayedByWeather"),
            type = "prob",
            writeModelVars = TRUE)',
        @params = N'@model varbinary(max),
            @month integer,
            @originState char(2),
            @destState char(2)',
            @model = @weatherDelayModel,
            @month = @Month,
            @originState = @OriginState,
            @destState = @DestState
        WITH RESULT SETS (([PredictedDelay] float, [PredictedNoDelay] float, [PredictedDelayedByWeather] bit, [Month] integer, [OriginState] char(2), [DestState] char(2)));
    END
    ```

3. In the toolbar, click **Execute**. Verify that the code runs without any errors.
4. Return to your R development environment.
5. Add the following statements to the R file and run it. This code tests the stored procedure:

    ``` R
    cmd <- "EXEC [dbo].[PredictWeatherDelay] @Month = 10, @OriginState = 'MI', @DestState = 'NY'"
    sqlQuery(connection, cmd)
    ```

6. Save the script as **Lab8\_1Script.R** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08** folder, and close your R development environment.
7. Close SQL Server Management Studio, without saving any changes.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have saved the DForest model to SQL Server, and created a stored procedure that you can use to make weather delay predictions using this model.

## Lab B: Incorporating Hadoop Map/Reduce and Spark functionality into the ScaleR workflow

## Exercise 1: Using Pig with ScaleR functions

### Preparation

2. Follow the instructions in the document **Creating the Hadoop Cluster on Azure** to deploy and configure an Azure HDInsight cluster.
3. In the Azure portal, go to the **LON-HADOOP-SERVER** resource group, and click the **LON-HADOOP-*nn*** HDInisght cluster.
4. On the **LON-HADOOP-*nn*** blade, in the **R Server dashboards** section, click **Ambari home**.
5. In the **Sign in** dialog box, sign in as **admin** with password **Pa55w.rdPa55word**.
6. On the **Ambari** page, in the left pane, click **Tez**.
7. Click the **Configs** tab.
8. Expand the **Advanced tez-site** section.
9. Change the value of the **tez.runtime.io.sort.mb** configuration setting to **1024 MB**.
10. Click **Save**.
11. In the **Save Configuration** dialog box, click **Save**.
12. In the **Configurations** dialog box, click **Proceed Anyway**.
13. In the **Save Configuration Changes** dialog box, click **OK**.
14. Click **Restart**, and then click **Restart All Affected**.
15. In the **Confirmation** dialog box, click **Confirm Restart All**.
16. Wait for the Tez components to restart, and then click **OK**.

### Task 1: Examine the Pig script

1. Log on to the **LON-DEV** VM as **Adatum\\AdatumAdmin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. Using **WordPad**, open the file **carrierDelays.pig** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08** folder.
3. Review the script.
4. Edit the first line of the script, and change the text **{specify login name}** to **sshuser**, as shown in the following example:

    ```Text
    %declare loginName 'sshuser'
    ```

5. Save the file and close Wordpad.

### Task 2: Upload the Pig script and flight delay data to HDFS

1. Using **File Explorer**, go to the folder **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08**, right-click the file **FlightDelayDataSample.zip**, and then click **Extract All**.
2. In the **Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders** dialog box, specify the folder **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08**, and then click **Extract**.
3. Start your R development environment of choice (Visual Studio, or RStudio), and create a new R file.
4. In the script editor, add the following statements to the R file and run them. These statements establish a new **RxHadoopMR** compute context:

    ```R
    loginName = "sshuser"
    context <- RxHadoopMR(sshUsername = loginName,
        sshHostname = "LON-HADOOP",
        consoleOutput = TRUE)
    rxSetComputeContext(context, wait = TRUE)
    ```

5. Add the following statements to the R file and run them. This code removes the **FlightDelayDataSample.csv** file from your directory in HDFS (if it exists; you can ignore the error message if it is not found), and copies the latest data from the E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08 folder:

    ```R
    rxHadoopRemove(path = paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, "/FlightDelayDataSample.csv", sep=""))
    rxHadoopCopyFromClient(source = "E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08\\FlightDelayDataSample.csv",
        hdfsDest = paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, sep=""))
    ```

6. Add the following statements to the R file and run them. This code uploads the **carriers.csv** file to your directory in HDFS. Note that this is a large file, and it will take a couple of minutes to upload:

    ```R
    rxHadoopRemove(path = paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, "/carriers.csv", sep=""))
    rxHadoopCopyFromClient(source = "E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08\\carriers.csv",
        hdfsDest = paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, sep=""))
    ```

7. Switch to the Azure portal.
8. On the navigation blade on the left side of the portal, click **Resource groups**.
9. Click the **LON-HADOOP-SERVER** resource group.
10. On the **LON-HADOOP-SERVER** blade, click the **ipConfig1** Public IP address.
11. On the **ipConfig1** blade, make a note of the IP address.
12. Return to your R development environment.
13. Add the following statements to the R file and run them. Replace the text **ipaddress** with value of the **ipConfig1** public IP address for the edge node of the cluster. This code closes the **RxHadoopMR** compute context, creates a remote R session on the Hadoop cluster, and loads the **RevoScaleR** library in that session:

    ```R
    rxSetComputeContext(RxLocalSeq())
    remoteLogin(deployr_endpoint = "http://*ipaddress*:12800", session = TRUE, diff = TRUE, commandline = TRUE,      username = "admin", password = "Pa55w.rd")
    library(RevoScaleR)
    ```

14. Add the following statements to the R file and run them. This code copies the Pig script (and the **loginName** variable) to the remote session:

    ```R
    pause()
    putLocalFile("E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08\\carrierDelays.pig")
    putLocalObject(c("loginName"))
    resume()
    ```

### Task 3: Run the Pig script and examine the results

1. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This code runs the Pig script:

   ```R
    result <- system("pig carrierDelays.pig", intern = TRUE)
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code lists the contents of the /user/RevoShare/sshuser directory in HDFS. This directory should include a subdirectory named **results**:

    ```R
    rxHadoopCommand(paste("fs -ls -R /user/RevoShare/", loginName, sep = ""), intern = TRUE)
    ```

3. Verify that the results directory contains two files: **\_SUCCESS** and **part-r-00000**. The data is actually in the part-r-00000 file.
4. Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This code deletes the **\_SUCCESS** file from the **results** directory:

    ```R
    rxHadoopRemove(paste("fs -ls -R /user/RevoShare/", loginName, "/results/_SUCCESS", sep = ""))
    ```

5. Add the following statements to the R file and run them. These statements display the structure of the results generated by the Pig script:

    ```R
    rxOptions(reportProgress = 1)
    rxSetFileSystem(RxHdfsFileSystem())
    resultsFile <- paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, "/results", sep = "")
    resultsData <- RxTextData(resultsFile)
    rxGetVarInfo(resultsData)
    ```

### Task 4: Convert the results to XDF format and add field names

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it:

    ```R
    carrierDelayColInfo <- list(V1 = list(type = "factor", newName = "Origin"),
        V2 = list(type = "factor", newName = "Dest"),
        V3 = list(type = "factor", newName = "AirlineCode"),
        V4 = list(type = "character", newName = "AirlineName"),
        V5 = list(type = "numeric", newName = "CarrierDelay"),
        V6 = list(type = "numeric", newName = "LateAircraftDelay")
    )
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates the **CarrierData** composite XDF file in HDFS:

    ```R
    carrierFile <- RxXdfData(paste("/user/RevoShare", loginName, "CarrierData", sep = "/"))
    carrierData <- rxImport(inData = resultsData,
        outFile = carrierFile, overwrite = TRUE,
        colInfo = carrierDelayColInfo,
        createCompositeSet = TRUE
    )
    ```

3. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates a new **RxHadoopMR** compute context in the remote session:

    ```R
    hadoopContext = RxHadoopMR(sshUsername = loginName, consoleOutput = TRUE)
    rxSetComputeContext(hadoopContext)
    ```

4. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code displays the structure of the XDF file which should now include the new mappings:

    ```R
    rxGetVarInfo(carrierData)
    ```

5. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code summarizes the contents of the XDF file:

    ```R
    rxSummary(~., carrierData)
    ```

    > **Note:** This function runs as a Map/Reduce job

### Task 5: Create graphs to visualize the airline delay data

1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates a data frame that contains the airline delay information (carrier delay plus late aircraft delay), and then uses this data frame to generate a histogram of delay times:

    ```R
    transformedCarrierData <- rxDataStep(carrierData, transforms = list(TotalDelay = CarrierDelay + LateAircraftDelay))
    # The data source for this histogram is an in-memory data frame, so the processing is not distributed
    rxHistogram(~TotalDelay, data = transformedCarrierData,
        xTitle = "Carrier + Late Aircraft Delay (minutes)",
        yTitle = "Occurrences",
        endVal = 300
    )
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code changes the resolution of the plot window to 1024 by 768 pixels, and then generates a histogram showing the number of delayed flights for each airline:

    ```R
    png(width=1024, height=768);rxHistogram(~AirlineCode, data = carrierData,
        xTitle = "Airline",
        yTitle = "Number of delayed flights"
    );dev.off()
    ```

3. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates a bar chart showing the total delay time for all flights made by each airline:

    ```R
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(data = rxImport(carrierData, transforms = list(TotalDelay = CarrierDelay + LateAircraftDelay))) +
        geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = AirlineName, y = TotalDelay), stat = "identity") +
        labs(x = "Airline", y = "Total Carrier + Late Aircraft Delay (minutes)") +
        scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) { lapply(strwrap(x, width = 25, simplify = FALSE), paste, collapse = "\n")}) +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 8))
    ```

### Task 6: Investigate the mean airline delay by route

1. Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code creates a data cube that calculates the mean delay for each airline by route:

    ```R
    delayData <- rxCube(AverageDelay ~ AirlineCode:Origin:Dest, carrierData,
        transforms = list(AverageDelay = CarrierDelay + LateAircraftDelay),
        means = TRUE,
        na.rm = TRUE,
        removeZeroCounts = TRUE
    )
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code uses the **rxExec** function to run **rxSort** to sort the data in the cube:

    ```R
    sortedDelayData <- rxExec(FUN=rxSort, as.data.frame(delayData), sortByVars = c("Counts", "AverageDelay"), decreasing = c(TRUE, TRUE), timesToRun = 1)
    ```

3. Add the following code to the R script and run it. This the top 50 rows in the sorted cube (the routes with the most frequent and longest delays).

    ```R
    head(sortedDelayData$rxElem1, 50)
    ```

4. Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code shows the bottom 50 rows in the sorted cube (the routes with the least frequent and shortest delays):

    ```R
    tail(sortedDelayData$rxElem1, 50)
    ```

5. Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code switches to the local compute context and saves the data cube to the file SortedDelayData.csv in HDFS:

    ```R
    rxSetComputeContext(RxLocalSeq())
    sortedDelayDataFile <- paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, "/SortedDelayData.csv", sep = "")
    sortedDelayDataCsv <- RxTextData(sortedDelayDataFile)
    sortedDelayDataSet <- rxDataStep(inData = sortedDelayData$rxElem1,
        outFile = sortedDelayDataCsv, overwrite = TRUE
    )
    ```

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have run a Pig script from R, and analyzed the data that the script produces.

## Exercise 2: Integrating ScaleR code with Spark and Hive

### Task 1: Upload the sorted delay data to Hive

1. Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code creates an **RxSpark** compute context:

    ```R
    sparkContext = RxSpark(sshUsername = loginName,
        consoleOutput = TRUE,
        numExecutors = 10,
        executorCores = 2,
        executorMem = "1g",
        driverMem = "1g"
    )
    rxSetComputeContext(sparkContext)
    ```

2. Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code creates an **RxHiveData** data source:

    ```R
    dbTable <- "RouteDelays"
    hiveDataSource <- RxHiveData(table = dbTable)
    ```

3. Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code uploads the data to Hive:

    ```R
    data <- rxDataStep(inData = sortedDelayDataSet,
        outFile = hiveDataSource, overwrite = TRUE)
    ```

4. Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code runs the **rxSummary** function over the Hive data:

    ```R
    rxSummary(~., hiveDataSource)
    ```

### Task 2: Use Hive to perform ad-hoc queries over the data

1. Open a command prompt window, and run the **putty** command.
2. In the **PuTTY Configuration** window, select the **LON-HADOOP** session, click **Load**, and then click **Open**. You should be logged in to the Hadoop VM.
3. In the PuTTY terminal window, run the following command:

    ```Bash
    /usr/bin/hive
    ```

4. At the **hive\>** prompt, run the following command:

    ```SQL
    select * from routedelays;
    ```

    Verify that 8852 rows are retrieved.

5. At the **hive\>** prompt, run the following command:

    ```SQL
    select count(*), airlinecode from routedelays group by airlinecode;
    ```

    This command lists each airline together with the number of delayed flights for that airline.

6. At the **hive\>** prompt, run the following command to exit hive:

    ```SQL
    exit;
    ```

7. Close the PuTTY terminal window, and return to your R development environment.
8. Save the script as **Lab8\_2Script.R** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08** folder, and close your R development environment.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have used R code running in an RxSpark compute context to upload data to Hive, and then analyzed the data by performing Hive queries.
