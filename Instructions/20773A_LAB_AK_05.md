## Lab: Parallelizing analysis operations

## Exercise 1: Capturing flight delay times and frequencies

### Task 1: Create a shared folder

If you have not already created the **E:\\Data** share in an earlier lab, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the  VM as **.\\student** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. Using File Explorer, create a new folder named **E:\\Data**.
3. In File Explorer, right-click the **E:\\Data** folder, click **Share with**, and then click **Specific people**.
4. In the **File Sharing** dialog box, click the drop-down list, click **Everyone**, and then click **Add**.
5. In the lower pane, click the **Everyone** row, and set the **Permission Level** to **Read/Write**.
6. Click **Share**.
7. In the **File Sharing** dialog box, verify that the file share is named **E:\\Data**, and then click **Done**.

### Task 2: Copy the data

1. Log in to the  VM as **.\\student** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. Using **File Explorer**, move to the folder **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab05**, and then double-click the file **FlightDelayData.part01.exe**
3. In the **WinRAR self-extracting archive** dialog box, click **Extract**. Overwrite the existing file if prompted.
4. Open a command prompt window.
5. At the command prompt, run the following commands:

    ```CMD
    
    copy E:\Labfiles\Lab05\FlightDelayData.xdf E:\Data
    ```

6. If the **Overwrite** message appears, type **y**, and then press Enter.
7. Verify that the files are copied successfully, and then close the command prompt window.

### Task 3: Create the class generator for the PemaFlightDelays class

1. Start your R development environment of choice (Visual Studio Tools, or RStudio), and create a new R file.
2. Add the following statement to your R script, and run it. This statement installs the **dplyr** package:

    ```R
    install.packages("dplyr")
    ```

3. Add the following code to your R script, and run it. These statements bring the **dplyr** and **RevoPemaR** libraries into scope:

    ```R
    library(dplyr)
    library(RevoPemaR)
    ```

4. Add the following code to your R script, but do not run it yet. Code defines the **PemaFlightDelays** class generator:

    ```R
    PemaFlightDelays <- setPemaClass(
        Class = "PemaFlightDelays",
        contains = "PemaBaseClass",
    )
    ```

5. Add the following code to your R script, after the **contains** line, but before the closing brace. Do not run it yet. This code adds the fields to the class:

    ```R
    fields = list(
        totalFlights = "numeric",
        totalDelays = "numeric",
        origin = "character",
        dest = "character",
        airline = "character",
        delayTimes = "vector",
        results = "list"
    ),
    ```

6. Add the following code to your R script, after the **fields** list, but before the closing brace. Do not run it yet. This code defines the **initialize** method:

    ```R
    methods = list(
        initialize = function(originCode = "", destinationCode = "",
        airlineCode = "", ...) {

        'initialize fields'
        callSuper(...)
        usingMethods(.pemaMethods)
        totalFlights <<- 0
        totalDelays <<- 0
        delayTimes <<- vector(mode="numeric", length=0)
        origin <<- originCode
        dest <<- destinationCode
        airline <<- airlineCode
    },
    ```

7. Add the following code to your R script, after the **initialize** method, but before the closing brace. Do not run it yet. This code defines the **processData** method:

    ```R
    processData = function(dataList) {
        'Generates a vector of delay times for specified variables in the current chunk of data.'
        data <- as.data.frame(dataList)

        # If no origin was specified, default to the first value in the dataset
        if (origin == "") {
            origin <<- as.character(as.character(data$Origin[1]))
        }

        # If no destination was specified, default to the first value in the dataset
        if (dest == "") {
            dest <<- as.character(as.character(data$Dest[1]))
        }

        # If no airline was specified, default to the first value in the dataset
        if (airline == "") {
            airline <<- as.character(as.character(data$UniqueCarrier[1]))
        }

        # Use dplyr to filter by origin, dest, and airline
        # update the number of flights
        # select the Delay variable
        # only include delayed flights in the results
        data %>%
            filter(Origin == origin, Dest == dest, UniqueCarrier == airline) %T>%
            {totalFlights <<- totalFlights + length(.$Origin)} %>%
            select(ifelse(is.na(Delay), 0, Delay)) %>%
            filter(Delay > 0) -> temp

        # Store the result in the delayTimes vector
        delayTimes <<- c(delayTimes, as.vector(temp[,1]))
        totalDelays <<- length(delayTimes)
        invisible(NULL)
    },
    ```

8. Add the following code to your R script, after the **processData** method, but before the closing brace. Do not run it yet. This code defines the **updateResults** method:

    ```R
    updateResults = function(pemaFlightDelaysObj) {
        'Updates total observations and delayTimes vector from another PemaFlightDelays object object.'

        # Update the totalFlights and totalDelays fields
        totalFlights <<- totalFlights + pemaFlightDelaysObj$totalFlights
        totalDelays <<- totalDelays + pemaFlightDelaysObj$totalDelays

        # Append the delay data to the delayTimes vector
        delayTimes <<- c(delayTimes, pemaFlightDelaysObj$delayTimes)
        invisible(NULL)
    },
    ```

9. Add the following code to your R script, after the **updateResults** method, but before the closing brace. Do not run it yet. This code defines the **processResults** method:

    ```R
    processResults = function() {
        'Generates a list containing the results:'
        ' The first element is the number of flights made by the airline'
        ' The second element is the number of delayed flights'
        ' The third element is the list of delay times'
        results <<- list("NumberOfFlights" = totalFlights,
            "NumberOfDelays" = totalDelays,
            "DelayTimes" = delayTimes)
        return(results)
        }
    )
    ```

10. Highlight and run the code you have entered in the previous steps, starting at step 4, in this task. Verify that no errors are reported.

### Task 4: Test the PemaFlightDelays class using a data frame

1. Add the following statement to your R script and run it. This statement creates an instance of the **PemaFlightDelays** class in a variable named **pemaFlightDelaysObj**:

    ```R
    pemaFlightDelaysObj <- PemaFlightDelays()
    ```

2. Add the following statement to your R script, and run it. This statement creates a remote connection to the LON-RSVR VM. Specify the username **admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd** when prompted:

    ```R
    remoteLogin("http://localhost:12800", session = TRUE, diff = TRUE, commandline = TRUE)
    ```

3. At the **REMOTE>** prompt, add and run the following command to temporarily pause the remote session:

    ```R
    pause()
    ```

4. Add and run the following statement. This statement copies the local variable **pemaFlightDelaysObj** to the remote session:

    ```R
    putLocalObject("pemaFlightDelaysObj")
    ```

5. Add and run the following statement to resume the remote session:

    ```R
    resume()
    ```

6. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them:

    ```R
    install.packages("dplyr")
    library(dplyr)
    library(RevoPemaR)
    ```

7. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. These statements create a data frame comprising the first 50,000 observations from the **FlightDelayData.xdf** file in the E:\\Data share.

    ```R
    flightDelayDataFile <- ("E:\\Data\\FlightDelayData.xdf")
    flightDelayData <- RxXdfData(flightDelayDataFile)
    testData <- rxDataStep(flightDelayData, numRows = 50000)
    ```

8. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. This code uses the **pemaCompute** function to run the **pemaFlightDelaysObj** object to perform an analysis of flights from "ABE" to "PIT" made by airline "US":

    ```R
    result <- pemaCompute(pemaObj = pemaFlightDelaysObj, data = testData, originCode = "ABE",destinationCode = "PIT", airlineCode = "US")
    print(result)
    ```

9. Verify that the results resemble the following data:

    ```Text
    $NumberOfFlights
    [1] 755
    $NumberOfDelays
    [1] 188
    $DelayTimes
    [1] 3 10 3 16 54 2 61 65 54 12 18 23 92 16 153 7 18 2
    [19] 21 61 2 1 1 4 40 67 1 82 6 3 112 298 39 21 13 2
    [37] 1 12 2 131 474 85 27 352 9 2 49 24 18 60 43 28 126 109
    [55] 40 39 53 34 120 3 274 73 57 3 83 27 58 53 15 8 58 61
    [73] 1 117 34 32 9 19 66 44 2 82 17 21 9 103 2 45 4 64
    [91] 3 48 52 17 5 11 7 1 18 23 43 29 7 46 22 71 16 18
    [109] 9 62 27 120 10 12 11 6 10 4 50 4 1 6 1 129 3 9
    [127] 185 5 11 17 19 171 2 81 3 17 1 33 21 2 45 8 27 29
    [145] 42 25 40 5 1 15 1 59 4 10 6 81 13 45 37 6 9 1
    [163] 7 1 2 2 2 5 109 3 15 7 25 58 17 45 289 5 7 7
    [181] 38 89 3 34 12 15 129 19
    ```

10. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. This code displays the values of the internal fields in the **pemaFlightDelaysObj** object:

    ```R
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$delayTimes)
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$totalDelays)
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$totalFlights)
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$origin)
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$dest)
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$airline)
    ```

### Task 5: Use the PemaFlightDelays class to analyze XDF data

1. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. This code creates a subset of the flight delay data as an XDF file with a small block size:

    ```R
    flightDelayDataSubsetFile <- ("E:\\Data\\FlightDelayDataSubset.xdf")
    testData2 <- rxDataStep(flightDelayData, flightDelayDataSubsetFile,
        overwrite = TRUE, numRows = 50000, rowsPerRead = 5000)
    ```

2. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. This code performs the same analysis as before, but using the XDF file:

    ```R
    result <- pemaCompute(pemaObj = pemaFlightDelaysObj, data = testData2, originCode = "ABE",destinationCode = "PIT", airlineCode = "US")
    print(result)
    ```

3. Verify that the results are the same as before (755 flights, with 188 delayed).
4. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. This code performs the same analysis as before, but using the complete XDF file. This job will take a couple of minutes to complete:

    ```R
    result <- pemaCompute(pemaObj = pemaFlightDelaysObj, data = flightDelayData, originCode = "LAX", destinationCode = "JFK", airlineCode = "DL")
    print(result)
    ```

5. Examine the results. Note the number of flights made, the number of flights that were delayed, and the length of the longest delay.
6. Save the script as **Lab5Script.R** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab05** folder, and close your R development environment.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created and run a PEMA class that finds the number of times flights that match a specified origin, destination, and airline are delayed—and how long each delay was.
